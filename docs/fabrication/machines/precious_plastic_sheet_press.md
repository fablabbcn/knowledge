# Precious Plastic Sheet Press (under construction)

![](../../assets/sheet-press-01.jpg)

## Technical specifications

- **Brand:** Fab Lab Barcelona (concept by Precious Plastic)
- **Work area:** Laser cutting room 
- **Materials:** Thermoplastics (PLA, HDPE, LDPE, PET, PP, PS...), biomaterials, other
- **Technology:** Heating, pressing, moulding
- **Machine parts:**  ///MACHINE PARTS DIAGRAM///

## Applications

  - Creating sheets (from 3mm to 15mm thick) with thermoplastics. The size of the sheet depends on the frame used.
  - Using the pressure to compress a material.
  - Using the heated platforms to melt a material.
  - ///IMAGES OF APPLICATIONS///

## Health & Safety

**CAUTION: This machine is highly exposed to the user. The platforms can reach very hot temperatures (over 300Â°C), so it is important to be well protected and to follow the operating instructions.**

- **Safety information:**
  - Be always aware of the temperature of both platforms.
  - Use welding gloves to manipulate anything between the two platforms of the press when the heat is ON.
  - Some thermoplastics expel toxic fumes when melted. Use safety goggles and mask if needed.
  - Be careful with long hair and other stuff that can get caught by the press.
  - Don't use more pressure than what is needed. This could damage the machine.
  - Don't use earphones. Being able to hear and smell is fundamental when using Precious Plastic machines.
  - Safety button just turns off the machine, but platforms take long to cool down.
  - IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT OR YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING, ASK! :)

## Operation

**a.** timer (the press will not heat up if a time is not set)
**b.** upper plate power indicator
**c.** upper plate temperature indicator and control
**d.** lower plate power indicator
**e.** lower plate temperature indicator and control

**f.** main power key switch
**g.** emergancy power off mushroom button
**h.** opperating indicator light

**Steps of Opperation**

1. Plug in the Sheetpress, check that the emergency stop **(g.)** is released and switch on the main power switch **(f.)**.
2. Check the required temperature to melt your type of plastic and set the plate temperature controllers **(c.+e.)** to this temperature.
3. Set a time of the timer **(a.)**, this can be the specific time reuired for the process or an arbitrary amount. **The press will not begin to heat if a time is not set.**
4. Close the pressing plates using the bottle jack and wait for them to heat up.
5. When the Sheetpress is at the desired temperature, open the pressing plates of the Sheetpress by releasing pressure from the bottle jack.
6. Place the bottom sheet of the mould on the bottom pressing plate and apply a layer of silicone oil or suitbale lubricant. Make sure to remove any remnants of the previous sheet.
7. Place the mould frame in the centre of the sheet and apply a layer of silicone oil to the top of the frame.
8. Load the plastic into the mould.
9. Spread the plastic evenly across the area inside the mould frame with slightly less around a 100mm border offset on the inside of the edges.
10. Oil the top sheet of the mould and place the oiled side face down on the bottom two sections of the mould.
11. Close the pressing plates using the bottle jack until the pressure gauge reads the desired pressure. **Do not exceed 10tons.**
12. Continually monitor the pressure gauge as the plastic with compress as it melts.
13. When the mould has been in the Sheetpress for the required melting time, switch off the Sheetpress and allow to cool in situ.
14. Alternatively you can take out the mould and either weight it down or clamp it to allow the sheet to cool externally.

## Maintenance
Borrowed from Precious Plastic: https://onearmy.github.io/academy/build/sheetpressrun#-maintain 

**Weekly**
- Clean the heating plates - Scrape any remiant material from the heating plates. You may need to use a high volume alcohol if there is heavy corrosion
- Grease rails - Use a wooden spatula to apply a liberal amount of grease to all the rails.

**Monthly**
- Inspect and replace mould sheets - Inspect your mould sheets, if any of them are damaged beyond repair then they may need replacing.
- Check website for hacks/updates - The community are continuously developing hacks, modifications and techniques which get shared on the internet, take a look to see what is there that can help or inspire you!

**Yearly**
- Deep clean heating plates - Scrape any remiant material from the heating plates. You may need to use a high volume alcohol if there is heavy corrosion. You may also need to use a rotary sander to remove tough burnt on material but be gentle, use a high grit sandpaper (>220) to preserve the flatness of the sheet.
- Check oil in jacks - Bleed and replace the oil in the jacks.
- Check electronics - Check the resistance of your elements on each of the three phases is equal to the number of heating elements attached to each phase. If it does not one of your heating elements may be broken, use a thermal camera to check. Check all the components inside the enclosure for visual signs of melting/burning and replace anything that appears damaged. Re paint worn areas Check the body panels and frame for signs of ware, repaint any exposed metal to protect it from corrosion.

## Useful information

- Don't retract the plate further than you need as the jack moves in very small increments and it takes a long time to raise the plate

## Troubleshooting

- Plates are not heating. - Timer **(a.)** not set // Power indicators **(b.+d.))** not illuminated // Emergancy power off mushroom button **(g.)** engaged
- Press is creating fumes or smoke. - Check that the temperatures are set correctly for the material being used // Check no plastic material is in direct contact with heated plates

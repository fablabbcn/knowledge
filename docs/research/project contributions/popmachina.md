## Project description

The EU-funded POP-MACHINA aims to promote  a more circular production paradigm, engaging communities, and promoting urban and community development achieved through collaborative production in cities. The project will create a network of existing and new communities in urban areas and use cutting-edge technologies (factory-of-the-future, blockchain) to engage urban planning, boost social dialogue, recognise local needs in training and skills development. The partners will share open source practices and develop a framework for implementing circular collaborative production in urban areas.
